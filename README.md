## About
This project is the game 2048 in text format and an AI program that attempts to win the game as many times as possible. A description of the game can be found atht this site: https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/. The current AI can win the game 60 percent of the time, and get to the 4096 tile about 2 times out of 1000. The method I used is similar to how computers play chess. The AI tries to look a few moves ahead while weighing the board states based on the position of the tiles and then picks the move with the best probable outcome. Some challenges faced with this was considering what makes a good board, and figuring out which method of calculating the goodness of the board should weigh more. Also, I programmed the AI based on some assumptions I have made about an optimal strategy to play the game, which could actually be hindering the AI.

## Next Steps
I plan to completely change the AI so that my assumptions of the game aren't taken into consideration and the AI can figure out the game on its own. I also want to implement a new method of figuring out the goodness of the board.
